title: Magit, an Emacs Mode for Git
---

As I said, "I'm mad for Emacs". Today I want to introduce a new Emacs mode --
magit (you can think it as "magic git").

## Magit Status
Magit status window is that it plays nice with your window configuration
when you open it, and when you close it with q. Almost all the actions you
can carry out in Magit is done through a one-key system that opens up
a “command console” window at the bottom, letting you further refine your
command before you carry it out. This is a fantastically well-done interface
and is probably the killer feature that makes Magit so great.
